# of blocks = 10000

tRead - elapsed time: 0m0.675s; sys time: 0m0.609s

Observations:
tRead is slower than aRead in general in terms of running time. More specifi-cally, the elapsed time and sys time for tRead is much closer than those of aRead. 

Explanation:
tRead uses multi-threads to hide asynchrony, thus, it's run time is much fas-ter than sRead. However, it requires the operating system to handle multipl-e threads, which leads to it being slower than aRead, with a higher sys tim-e.
